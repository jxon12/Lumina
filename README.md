Lumina - Academic & Innovation Collaboration Ecosystem

Lumina is a decentralized platform designed to help students find mentors, research partners, and collaborate efficiently. By integrating psychological principles with gamified design, Lumina aims to lower social barriers and boost academic engagement.

🌟 Core Concept

"Illuminate Your Potential. Find Your Wavelength."

Lumina is more than just a social network; it is a "Micro-Mentorship" and "Gamified Research" platform.

Spark Protocol (Micro-Commitments): Overcomes the fear of reaching out to mentors by facilitating specific, low-commitment "15-minute coffee chats."

Quest Board (RPG Task Board): Breaks down complex research projects into RPG-style quests with skill level requirements, providing accessible entry points for newcomers.

Fluid Circles: Enables dynamic connections based on real-time status and interests, rather than rigid, traditional groups.

✨ Key Features

Spark Matchmaker: AI-powered matching system for mentors and partners that considers not just skills but also personality traits.

Dynamic Bento Grid UI: Features a premium, Apple-inspired Bento Grid layout for clear and aesthetic information presentation.

Dual-Mode Interface: Supports both Ceramic White and Aurora Black themes for a comfortable experience day and night.

Real-time Collaboration: Integrated real-time chat, code snippet sharing, and status synchronization.

XP & Badges System: A comprehensive gamified incentive system that tracks and rewards every academic contribution.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) - The modern full-stack React framework.

Styling: Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Animation: Framer Motion - A production-ready motion library for React.
